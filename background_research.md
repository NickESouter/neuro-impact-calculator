# Background Research

This document can be used to collate resources that will inform tool creation. 

As a starting point, the following papers provide some discussion of why it's important to pay attention to the carbon foopring of MRI scanning and neuroscience research:

* [Jackson (2023)] [1]
* [McKee et al. (2024)] [2]
* [Rae et al. (2022)][3]
* [Aron et al. (2020][4]

On a practical note, the following papers can be used to estimate the energy usage of MRI scanning:

* [Woolen et al. (2023)][5]
* [Chodorowski et al. (2024)][6]
* [Alerte et al. (2025)][7]

And these papers can be used to estimate the energy usage of fMRI data processing and storage:
